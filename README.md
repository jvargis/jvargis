- 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob Vargis ... @jvargis
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity in general, and more specifically, exploring ways to secure cyberspace for the elderly.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching multiple disciplines to develop a framework to design and develop assistive cyber technologies to compensate for behavioral vulnerabilities associated with cognitive decline. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who shares my interest, or have solutions that may further my objectives.
- 📫 I can be reached at jacobvargis@gmail.com
